# File Versioning

Keeping track of different version of a project can be a tedious task. Git aims at solving this issue by offering a suite of commands to create and manage different version of a repository in a convenient fashion.
Git allows to track, view, delete, edit different version of a project; and plenty more.
<br/>Moreover, Git brings an easy way to work on different version of code concurrently and merge it back together. This is great when working in a team.
