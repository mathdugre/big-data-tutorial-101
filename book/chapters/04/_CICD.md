# Continuous Integration and Delivery
When developing code, it is inherent to introduce bugs.
However, it is important to be able to detect those bugs and be able to fix them quickly.
A great way to do this is to write test for the code.
<br/>With test covering a good portion of a code base, it becomes easier to make change knowing that it will not break the project.
This will greatly speedup development in the long run.
