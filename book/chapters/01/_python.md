# Tour of Python

Welcome to this brief overview of the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/).

Throughout this chapter, you will learn to:

- Install and configure a Python development environment;
- The syntax of Python;
- and some advanced feature of the language.

For an explanation of additional features, we suggest to refer to the [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).<br>
We also give credits to the official tutorial, which we based various of our Python examples from.
